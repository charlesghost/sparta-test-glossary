# Sparta Test Glossary

### Absence of Error
### Acceptance testing
### Alpha testing

Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers’ site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing.

### Appium
It's a open source corss-platform test automation tool for native, mobile web applications.

### Automation Testing
Automated testing is the use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.

### Behaviour Driven Development
### Beta testing

Beta Testing is also known as field testing. It takes place at customer’s site. It sends the system/software to users who install it and use it under real-world working conditions.

### Black box testing
### Bottom up

Bottom-up testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest level components are tested first, then used to facilitate the testing of higher level components. 

### Boundary Value Analysis
### Capybara
### Configuration Management
### Cucumber
### Data Parsing
### Debugging
### Defect
### Defect Clustering

### Dynamic Testing
Dynamic Testing is a kind of software testing technique using which the dynamic behaviour of the code is analysed. For Performing dynamic, testing the software should be compiled and executed and parameters such as memory usage, CPU usage, response time and overall performance of the software are analyzed.

### Early Testing
### Equivalence Partitions
### Error
### Error Guessing
### Evaluating Test Criteria
### Exhaustive testing
### Exploratory testing
### Failure
### Functional tests

### Gherkin Syntax
It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software's behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented. It bridges the gap between business and developers. Gherkin serves two purposes — documentation and automated tests. 

### Hybrid
It is an approach to Integration Testing which is a combination of Top Down and Bottom Up approaches. 

### IEEE-829

Standard for Software Test Documentation
Eight defined stages of software testing:

* Test Plan
* Test Design Specification
* Test Case Specification
* Test Procedure Specification
* Test Item Transmittal Report
* Test Incident Report
* Test Log
* Test Summary Report

### ISTQB
It stands for the "International Software Testing Qualifications Board". It's a software testing qualification certification organisation that operates internationally.

### Incident management
### Integration testing
### JMeter

### Mike Cohn's test Pyramid
The "Test Pyramid" is a metaphor that tells us to group software tests into buckets of different granularity. It also gives an idea of how many tests we should have in each of these groups.

### Incident management
The process of recognizing, investigating, taking action and disposing of incidents. It involves logging incidents, classifying them and identifying the impact.

JMeter
### Metric based testing
In software testing, Metric is a quantitative measure of the degree to which a system, system component, or process possesses a given attribute. In other words, metrics helps estimating the progress, quality and health of a software testing effort.

### Mobile testing
Mobile application testing is a process by which application software developed for handheld mobile devices is tested for its functionality, usability and consistency. Mobile application testing can be an automated or manual type of testing. <br>
Tool for testing an IOS app: Appium <br>
Tool for testing an Android app: Android Studio

## Risk Based Testing
An approach to testing to reduce the level of product risks and inform stakeholders of their status, starting in the initial stages of a project. It involves the identification of product risks and the use of risk levels to guide the test process.

### Non-functional tests
### Pesticide Paradox
### RSpec
### Regression Testing
It's a type of software testing that ensures that previously developed and tested software still performs the same way after it is changed or interfaced with other software. Changes may include software enhancements, patches, configuration changes, etc.

### Retesting
Retesting is testing of a particular bug after it has been fixed. Usually tester raises the bug when they find it while testing the product or its component. 

### Reusability
### Reviews

## Risk Based Testing
An approach to testing to reduce the level of product risks and inform stakeholders of their status, starting in the initial stages of a project. It involves the identification of product risks and the use of risk levels to guide the test process.

### Selenium
### State Transition Testing
A black-box test design technique in which test cases are designed to execute valid and invalid state transitions.
### Statement Testing
### Static testing
### Structural testing

### System Integration
It is a testing process that exercises a software system's coexistence with others. With multiple integrated systems, assuming that each have already passed system testing, System Integration proceeds to test their required interactions.

### System testing
### Test Analysis and Design
### Test Case
A test case is a document which consists of a set of conditions or actions which are performed on the software application in order to verify the expected functionality of the feature. Here we describe the end to end logical flow of a specific requirement with test data, prerequisites and expected results.
### Test Closure
### Test Coverage
Test coverage measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test. Wherever we can count things and can tell whether or not each of those things has been tested by some test, then we can measure coverage and is known as test coverage.<br>
The basic coverage measure is where the ‘coverage item’ is whatever we have been able to count and see whether a test has exercised or used this item.
There is danger in using a coverage measure. But, 100% coverage does not mean 100% tested. Coverage techniques measure only one dimension of a multi-dimensional concept. Two different test cases may achieve exactly the same coverage but the input data of one may find an error that the input data of the other doesn’t.<br>
There are many different types of coverages which we will look at in detail, in subsequent topic, some of them are:
1. Statement coverage
2. Decision coverage
3. Condition coverage<br>

### Test Design
Creating a set of inputs for given software that will provide a set of expected outputs.  The idea is to ensure that the system is working good enough and it can be released with as few problems as possible for the average user.<br>
There are two main categories of Test Design Techniques:<br>
1. Static Techniques<br>
2. Dynamic Techniques

### Test Driven Development
### Test Implementation and Execution
### Test Planning and Control
### Test tools
### Testing Roles
### Testing is context dependent
### Testing shows presence of defects

### Top down
Top-down integration testing is an integration testing technique used in order to simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet integrated.

### Traceability
### Unit testing

### Use Case testing
A black-box test design technique in which test cases are designed to execute scenarios of use cases.

### User journey/story
### Validation
### Verification
### White box testing

### YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
